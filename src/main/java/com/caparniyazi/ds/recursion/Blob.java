     * Finds the number of cells in the blob at (x, y).
     * <p/>
     * The recursive
     * step involves counting 1 for a cell that has the abnormal color and adding the counts for the
     * blobs that include each immediate neighbor cell. Each cell has eight immediate neighbors:
     * two in the horizontal direction, two in the vertical direction, and four in the diagonal
     * directions.
     * <p/>
     * If no neighbor has the abnormal color, then the result will be just 1. If any neighbor cell has
     * the abnormal color, then it will be counted along with all its neighbor cells that have the
     * abnormal color, and so on until no neighboring cells with abnormal color are encountered
     * (or the edge of the grid is reached). The reason for setting the color of the cell at (x, y) to a
     * temporary color is to prevent it from being counted again when its neighborsâ€™ blobs are
     * counted.
     *
     * @param x The x coordinate (column) of a blob cell
     * @param y The y coordinate (row) of a blob cell.
     * @return the number of cells in the blob at (x, y).
